# Work experience
* **Postdoctoral Researcher at King's College London**  
Jul 2017 - Present  
My project aims to understand how the microbiota is controlling the development of B cells in the human gut. The project involves using cellular and molecular methods to dissect the properties of human intestinal B cell subsets, their behavior at the host/microbiota interface, and the role of the gut in human B cell development. This cutting the edge research is in an area of critical importance to human health that is understudied because the tissues are difficult to access. 
  
    * Single-cell cloning of 60 gut human B cell receptors.
    * Identified new B cells subsets clonal relation using NGS analysis in R
    * Developed custom scripts to combine the Seurat and Immcanation pipeline for analysis of single B cells datasets from 10x Genomics experiments

* **Postdoctoral Researcher at East Carolina University**  
Sep 2015 - June 2017  
Obesity is a costly disease associated with numerous complications. One major complication of obesity is dysregulation of the immune system, which includes chronic inflammation and increased susceptibility to infection. We are conducting functional and mechanistic studies to test hypotheses on how obesity dysregulates aspects of the immune system and how omega-3 fatty acids can potentially improve immunity. We are currently focused on the inflammatory and humoral response to influenza infection in obesity. These studies are in collaboration with laboratories at the University of Melbourne, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and Michigan State University.  
  
    * Investigated the impact of obesity on B cell function in human subjects and murine models leading to 3 first authors publications.
    * Conducted a pre-clinical study to determine the influence of fish oil concentrate on B cell function in obese subjects.
    * Designed in vivo experiments to assess DHA-derived mediators’ impact on influenza infection resolution.
